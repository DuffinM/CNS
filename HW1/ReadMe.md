## Tutorial 1: Provision a Virtual Machine
### This tutorial consisted of provisioning an environment and initializing it in a way that allows it to be automatically created for every instance of vagrance. In this tutorial you create an HTML directory, write a provisioning script, configure vagrant, and deploy the webserver. 
## Tutorial 2: Configure the Network
### This tutorial takes the next steps after completing the first tutorial. This tutorial specifies the ports on the host machine and then accesses the web page created via the ipn. 

## Vagrant Provisioners: Chef Solo
### This provisioner allows users to be able to execute cookbooks on a user-created server. This allows users to be able to access different packaged cookbooks and assign temporary roles through paths. This allows users to be able to use cookbooks from other servers to help create and streamline the creation of other cookbooks. This provisioner allows for data-bags to be supported aiding in functionality.
