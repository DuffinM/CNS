## **Section 2: Research a Security Tool ** 
### Crackmapexec (CME) is used for pentesting Windows/ Active Directory environments. CME uses Linux as its operating system and utilizes Python as its programming language. CME is open source and is constantly receiving updates. CME examines the weaknesses in Active Directory security. It helps automate the security of large Active Directory networks and enables credentials to be gathered which allows privilege escalation and lateral movement. A database is used to store used and dumped credentials. Allows user to easily keep track of credentials sets and gain additional situational awareness in large Active Directory environments. It can test networks, facilitating enumeration, attacks, and post-exploitation that can be used on multiple network protocols.
