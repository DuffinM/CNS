## **Section 2: Splunk Training Course** 
### The e-learning section I did was the Intro to Splunk lesson. This lesson walked through the many different functions avaliable in the Splunk Enterprise application. One of the things that the training went over was the search function. There are three types of searches: Fast, Verbose, and Smart. The Fast search which turns off the discovery off for event searches and will have no event of field data. The Verbose mode returns all events and field data avaliable. The Smart mode has field discovery on for event searches, but no event of field data will be returned. To narrow searches a sub search can be added into the search to search more efficiently. You can also utilize different commands through pipe functions you can specify what you are searching for or specify the time that you are looking for something. Another way to specify the search you can utilize Boolean functions. There are three Boolean functions: AND, OR, and NOT. There are three users that are default. One user is Admin. This role has the most capabilities and is typically assigned to the member that has the most Splunk experience. Another role is Power. This role can edit all shared objects and alerts, tag events, and similar tasks. The final user is User. This role can create and edit its own saved searches, run searches, edit its own preferences, and create and edit event types.

## **Section 4: Windows Event ID ** 
### The Windows Event ID that we chose to exclude was Windows 4666 An application attempted an operation. This event logs Client Name, Client Domain, Client Context ID, Object Name, Scope Names, Application Name, Application Instance ID, role, groups, and operation name. This logged event helps identify abnormal activity and helps ensure compliance with regulatory mandates.
